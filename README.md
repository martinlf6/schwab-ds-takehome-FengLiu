# Cognitive AI â€“ Aspect-Based Sentiment on Financial Text
## Overview
We analyze financial text to produce advisor-ready insights using **aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA)** on the `financial_phrasebank` dataset.  
We (1) explore data, (2) extract aspects (entities/features), (3) fine-tune finance-domain transformers for sentence and aspect sentiment, and (4) aggregate insights for proactive client engagement.
